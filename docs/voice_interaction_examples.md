```

### Complex Command Processing

#### Multi-Component Request

**Voice Input**: _"Calculate my monthly budget if I earn $5000 and spend 30% on rent, 20% on food, and 15% on transportation, then save the breakdown"_

**Expected Flow**:

1. UtilityAgent performs multiple calculations
2. GeneralAgent organizes the budget breakdown
3. ProductivityAgent saves the structured data

**Expected Response**:

```
"I'll calculate your monthly budget breakdown and save it for you.

With a monthly income of $5,000:
- Rent (30%): $1,500
- Food (20%): $1,000
- Transportation (15%): $750
- Total allocated: $3,250
- Remaining budget: $1,750 (35%)

This leaves you with $1,750 for other expenses like savings, entertainment,
utilities, and miscellaneous costs.

I'm now saving this budget breakdown to 'monthly_budget_breakdown.txt'
