# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

## Current Focus

2025-08-14 18:19:44 - Successfully resolved critical Bark TTS initialization error caused by PyTorch 2.6 compatibility issues. The voice agent is now fully operational with all TTS backends working correctly.

2025-08-14 22:23:00 - **Memory Bank Integration**: Incorporating comprehensive existing documentation (INTEGRATION_TESTING.md, SETUP_REQUIREMENTS.md, TTS_SETUP.md, VOICE_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) into the memory bank for complete project context.

## Recent Changes

2025-08-14 18:19:44 - **RESOLVED: Bark TTS PyTorch 2.6 Compatibility Issue**

- Fixed "Weights only load failed" error in Bark TTS initialization
- Implemented monkey patch solution in `src/voice_agent/core/tts_service.py`
- Updated devenv.nix configuration for proper Python environment setup
- Created proper module entry point at `src/voice_agent/main.py`
- Verified full voice interaction pipeline works: speech detection → transcription → LLM processing → TTS synthesis

2025-08-14 18:19:44 - **Development Environment Improvements**

- Fixed PYTHONPATH configuration in devenv.nix
- Resolved Nix syntax errors in shell configuration
- Ensured local source directory takes precedence over store paths

```

**Configuration Management**:

- Default configuration: `voice_agent/config/default.yaml`
- Audio device configuration available via PyAudio device enumeration
- Model configuration for STT (Whisper sizes), LLM (Ollama models), TTS (engine selection)
- Environment variables for API keys (OpenWeatherMap) and debugging

## Open Questions/Issues

2025-08-14 18:19:44 - **Minor Audio Format Issue**: There's a non-critical "unknown format: 3" error in audio file loading that doesn't prevent functionality but could be investigated for completeness.

2025-08-14 22:23:00 - **Documentation Integration**: Need to complete incorporation of all existing documentation into memory bank for full project context preservation.

**Performance Optimization Opportunities**:

- Model preloading strategies for faster startup
- GPU acceleration configuration for CUDA-capable systems
- Memory optimization for resource-constrained environments
- Audio buffering tuning for lower latency

**Future Enhancement Opportunities**:

- Voice cloning capability with Coqui TTS
- Streaming STT for real-time transcription
- Advanced conversation memory and context management
- Desktop GUI wrapper for easier user interaction
- Docker containerization for deployment
  2025-08-15 00:20:45 - **Current Focus Update**: Initiated TUI enhancement phase. Added dedicated UIConfig (ui:) section (force_text_only, refresh_rate, max_messages, show_timestamps, color_scheme, enable_animations, enable_audio, keymap_overrides) to configuration and integrated idle text_only loop behavior in VoiceAgent.
  2025-08-15 00:20:45 - **Recent Change**: Decision log updated documenting UI configuration layer introduction and implications for future hybrid (voice+text) TUI mode.
  2025-08-15 00:20:45 - **Planned Next Tasks**: 1) Implement pipeline component state hooks (audio_input, stt, llm, tts, audio_output) for dynamic StatusBar updates. 2) Add help/settings/debug panels (F1/F2/F3). 3) Integrate error notification surface. 4) Apply keymap_overrides at TUI startup. 5) Implement chat search/filter and tool call visualization.

2025-08-14 22:14:15 - **Current Focus Update**: Implemented continuous dictation mode (F6) with aggregated preview message and per-segment STT metrics; added local `_record_metric` helper to TUI to eliminate AttributeError and surface segment latencies.
2025-08-14 22:14:15 - **Recent Change**: Keybinding reshuffle finalized: F5 push-to-talk (suppressed during dictation), F6 dictation toggle, F7 timestamps, F8 color scheme cycle, F9 animations, F10 export chat, F11 export logs, F12 metrics, Ctrl+Shift+L clear logs. Help/settings text aligned.
2025-08-14 22:14:15 - **Open Issue**: Need dictation cancel shortcut (discard without sending) and inactivity timeout; push-to-talk currently blocked during dictation via system notice but no explicit cancel.
2025-08-14 22:14:15 - **Planned Next Tasks**: 1) Add dictation cancel (Esc) and optional timeout/max duration. 2) Implement streaming LLM responses with interrupt key. 3) Add tests for dictation segment accumulation & push-to-talk suppression. 4) Persist UI toggle states (timestamps, color, animations) across sessions. 5) Extend metrics (aggregate averages, segment count display).
2025-08-14 22:18:25 - **Recent Change**: Fixed lingering ACTIVE animation after dictation stop. Updated `_stop_dictation` in TUI to force-reset `audio_input` / `stt` ComponentState from ACTIVE→READY if cancellation occurred mid `listen()`, and refresh status bar immediately.
2025-08-14 22:18:25 - **Result**: Indicators now correctly return to READY (static) after "(Dictation finished)" message; user confirmation received.
2025-08-14 22:18:25 - **Follow-up**: Add explicit dictation cancel (Esc) and inactivity timeout; add tests asserting post-stop states (READY) for audio_input and stt; consider centralizing state normalization in adapter teardown.
2025-08-15 02:22:50 - **UI Layout Change**: Separated status indicators into dedicated bordered window (#status_bar) above main scrollable chat window with borders; added PageUp/PageDown bindings and actions (scroll_chat_up/scroll_chat_down) enabling historical chat scrollback.
2025-08-15 02:22:50 - **Verification**: User confirmed status bar separation and functional scrollback.
2025-08-15 02:42:14 - **Recent Change**: Replaced manual virtualized chat rendering with native ScrollView in [`ChatLog.render()`](src/voice_agent/ui/tui_app.py:322) and tail-follow via [`ChatLog.add_message()`](src/voice_agent/ui/tui_app.py:281) calling `scroll_end()`. Removed diagnostic scroll system messages and offset-based pagination logic (legacy `_line_offset` now inert). Scroll actions updated to native scrolling methods (actions around [`VoiceAgentTUI.action_scroll_chat_up()`](src/voice_agent/ui/tui_app.py:1082)).  
2025-08-15 02:42:14 - **Current Focus Update**: Verifying restored scrollbar visibility, keyboard (PageUp/PageDown/Home/End) and mouse wheel support, and automatic tail follow after new messages.  
2025-08-15 02:42:14 - **Follow-up Tasks**: (1) Add automated scrolling behavior tests. (2) Optionally add compact position status widget (e.g., “120/450”). (3) Remove deprecated `_line_offset` & `_user_scrolled` artifacts once tests confirm stability. (4) Consider reintroducing page position indicator in separate widget instead of inline footer.
