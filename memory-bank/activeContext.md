# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

## Current Focus

2025-08-14 18:19:44 - Successfully resolved critical Bark TTS initialization error caused by PyTorch 2.6 compatibility issues. The voice agent is now fully operational with all TTS backends working correctly.

2025-08-14 22:23:00 - **Memory Bank Integration**: Incorporating comprehensive existing documentation (INTEGRATION_TESTING.md, SETUP_REQUIREMENTS.md, TTS_SETUP.md, VOICE_AGENT_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md) into the memory bank for complete project context.

## Recent Changes

2025-08-14 18:19:44 - **RESOLVED: Bark TTS PyTorch 2.6 Compatibility Issue**
- Fixed "Weights only load failed" error in Bark TTS initialization
- Implemented monkey patch solution in `src/voice_agent/core/tts_service.py`
- Updated devenv.nix configuration for proper Python environment setup
- Created proper module entry point at `src/voice_agent/main.py`
- Verified full voice interaction pipeline works: speech detection → transcription → LLM processing → TTS synthesis

2025-08-14 18:19:44 - **Development Environment Improvements**
- Fixed PYTHONPATH configuration in devenv.nix
- Resolved Nix syntax errors in shell configuration
- Ensured local source directory takes precedence over store paths

## Current Setup Status

**Environment Setup** (Based on SETUP_REQUIREMENTS.md):
- ✅ devenv/nix environment configured and working
- ✅ Python 3.12+ with all dependencies installed
- ✅ Audio system dependencies (portaudio, ALSA, PulseAudio) working
- ✅ Ollama installed and running with Mistral 7B model
- ✅ Whisper models auto-downloading on first use
- ✅ Multi-backend TTS system operational (Bark primary, fallbacks available)

**Testing Infrastructure** (Based on INTEGRATION_TESTING.md):
- ✅ Core component initialization tests available
- ✅ Individual tool testing framework in place
- ✅ Text-only conversation testing capability
- ✅ Audio component testing with 5-second recording tests
- ✅ STT testing with sample audio generation
- ✅ TTS testing with multiple backends
- ✅ Full voice interaction pipeline verified
- ✅ Performance benchmarking tools available

**Available Testing Commands**:
```bash
# Basic functionality tests
python main.py --debug                    # Full voice agent with debug logging
python main.py --no-audio                # Text-only mode
python voice_agent/examples/basic_chat.py # Voice interaction demo
python voice_agent/examples/tool_demo.py  # Tool functionality demo

# Component-specific tests
# Audio devices check, STT/TTS individual testing, LLM integration testing
# All documented in INTEGRATION_TESTING.md
```

**Configuration Management**:
- Default configuration: `voice_agent/config/default.yaml`
- Audio device configuration available via PyAudio device enumeration
- Model configuration for STT (Whisper sizes), LLM (Ollama models), TTS (engine selection)
- Environment variables for API keys (OpenWeatherMap) and debugging

## Open Questions/Issues

2025-08-14 18:19:44 - **Minor Audio Format Issue**: There's a non-critical "unknown format: 3" error in audio file loading that doesn't prevent functionality but could be investigated for completeness.

2025-08-14 22:23:00 - **Documentation Integration**: Need to complete incorporation of all existing documentation into memory bank for full project context preservation.

**Performance Optimization Opportunities**:
- Model preloading strategies for faster startup
- GPU acceleration configuration for CUDA-capable systems
- Memory optimization for resource-constrained environments
- Audio buffering tuning for lower latency

**Future Enhancement Opportunities**:
- Voice cloning capability with Coqui TTS
- Streaming STT for real-time transcription
- Advanced conversation memory and context management
- Desktop GUI wrapper for easier user interaction
- Docker containerization for deployment
